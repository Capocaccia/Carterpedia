    <h6><a href="http://capocaccia.github.io/CloudRunner/"><b><u>Cloud Runner</u></b></a></h6>
<p>Cloud Runner was taken on as Carters midterm project during his time at Nashville Software School. He chose to program a game using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser Game Framework</a>.  His choice to build a game was partly influenced by his long time hobby of video games and interest in exploring a new framework they had not used in during his time in school.  During the two weeks given for the project, Carters time was spent learning how to become a game developer.  He was able to achieve his goal of programming a game during the time frame by keeping the gameplay simple yet engaging.  <i><a href="http://capocaccia.github.io/CloudRunner/">Cloud Runner</a></i> is a game where you play an alien who needs some help getting home.  Hes new to this whole gravity thing and needs the players help to jump from cloud to cloud back in his spaceship.  You may view the source code for the game on <a href="https://github.com/Capocaccia/CloudRunner">Carters GitHub profile</a>.</p>
